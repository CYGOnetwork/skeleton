<h2>CYGO Privacy & User Rights Information</h2>
<p>___________________________________________________________</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy while you are using our services. Now available are privacy settings, available in the console menu, enabling you to control how your content is distributed across CYGO™ and other places on the internet (such as search engines). By default, all posts, photos, and profile details are public, meaning that they can be viewed by anyone with a CYGO™. This can be easily changed by using the dropdown console menu (hover over your avatar on the top navigation menu). Please note, that such settings are not editable from a mobile device, for account security reasons. </p>

<h3>Your rights as a user</h3>
<p>CYGO™ Network is considered private property, owned by webmaster and developer Logan L Johnson, of the NeoTech Enterprises USA organization. We have guidelines in place to keep our website a safe, comfortable, and friendly environment. Users are permitted to post any content which they desire to, however, content removal, account suspension, and account deletion are ultimately at the discretion of the volunteer moderators, as well as the administrator. We reserve the right to remove any posted content (including photos, videos, external links, etc), as well as suspend, or, in extreme cases, remove your account and issue an I.P. ban. We are not responsible for any content which is posted by default, non-team members on CYGO™, nor are we responsible for their actions. If you see some sort of illegal activity, please flag the account, or report the person to the proper authorities (your local police). We will not store personal messages, posts, or accounts for evidence purposes. CYGO™ is non-profit, and is funded by user contributions. All CYGO™ staff members are unpaid volunteers, working to help keep this wonderful service alive. </p>

<h3>Is user information shared with data-mining companies?</h3>
<p>No, CYGO™ will never share your information with data mining and research organizations, because, unlike some of our competitors, we value our users' privacy. We do not collect personal data in any way, profile details are voluntarily submitted, and will not be used for such purposes. However, we do still collect anonymous data using our custom analytics system, which helps us to optimize CYGO™ to run its best on the devices being used by our members, but, no personal information is collected in this process. </p>

<h3>Still have questions?</h3>
<p>Please contact CYGO™ administration via the official CYGO™ account on CYGO™ Network. </p>
