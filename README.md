# skeleton
Static pages integration for CYGO

## What does this do?
Skeleton enables anyone with superuser permissions to add static (HTML) pages to CYGO, and use its Authentication. 

## What goes here?
For security reasons, the server-side code (PHP) should NEVER be uploaded to this repository. Please only add static pages for
team collaboration.
